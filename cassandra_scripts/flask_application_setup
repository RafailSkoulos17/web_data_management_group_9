Main steps to deploy a Flask application on aws EC2

1) create an EC2 Ubuntu instance (specifications is up to you -- better with Python already installed)
2) connect with ssh (create or use existing key)
3) sudo apt-get update
4) sudo apt install python3-pip
5) pip3 install flask
6) sudo apt-get install nginx
7) sudo apt-get install gunicorn3
8) clone the github repository so that the app files are brought on the instance (or create them if they are few)
    |-> the structure can be seen in this directory
9) first we will make gunicorn into a service ->  cd /etc/systemd/system/
10) sudo vim userapp.service
11) the content can be found in the corresponding file in the directory
12) now do the same for orderapp.service, payment.service and stocks.service
13) reload the daemon with "sudo systemctl daemon-reload"
14) add an elastic ip address to the instance -> actions -> manage ip addresses -> alllocate an elastic ip
    -> amazon pool and close tab -> network & security -> elastic ip -> actions
    -> associate address and associate it with the instance
14) cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
15) sudo vim app_config (check the config file in this directory)
16) open the ports of the services on the instance
17) sudo service nginx restart (to start nginx)
18) sudo service userapp (orderapp/payment/stock) start (to start the services)
