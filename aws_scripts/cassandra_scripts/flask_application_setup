Main steps to deploy a Flask application on aws EC2

1) create an EC2 Ubuntu instance (specifications is up to you -- better with Python already installed)
2) connect with ssh (create or use existing key)
3) sudo apt-get update
4) sudo apt install python3-pip
5) pip3 install flask
6) sudo apt-get install nginx
7) sudo apt-get install gunicorn3
8) clone the github repository so that the app files are brought on the instance (or create them if they are few)
    |-> the structure can be seen in this directory
9) cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
10) sudo vim app_config (check the config file in this directory)
